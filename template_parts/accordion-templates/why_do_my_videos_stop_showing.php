If your videos show at first, but then stop showing during the day, you may be exceeding the YouTube APIâ€™s daily quota.
<br><br>
This shouldn't be a problem for most users, but if you have a lot of video views or page loads daily (or if you are sharing an API key), you may have to apply for a quota extension.
<br><br>
Refer to Google's own documentation for more about <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started#quota" target="_blank">how the daily quota is calculated</a>, or <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/yt_api_form" target="_blank">to apply for an extension</a>.
