* Select Settings from the dropdown menu.

If you have trouble finding it, refer to [Google's own documentation](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3250431?hl=en).

= How do I use the widget? =
Under **Appearance > Widgets**, add the Papaya YouTube Widget to the sidebar/widgetized area where you want your YouTube Channel featured. If you set a Channel ID for the Widget, it will override the Channel ID set on the settings page.

= How do I use the shortcode? =
Using the classic editor or the Gutenberg shortcode block, insert the shortcode **[papaya_youtube_widget]** into your site where you would like your YouTube channel videos to appear.

You can optionally add the following attributes to the shortcode:
* **channel_id:** A string that is a valid YouTube channel ID. Overrides the channel ID set in the plugin settings.
* **videos:** An integer between 1 and 25. The number of videos to display. Defaults to 5.
* **anchor:** Any alfa-numeric string. The anchor text for the link to the YouTube channel. Defaults to no link.

E.g. **[papaya_youtube_widget videos=9]** will insert a grid with nine videos into the post or page where you use the shortcode.

= Can I change the design or layout? =
Well, there aren't any settings for doing so, but you can make some changes with a bit of custom CSS in your theme customizer: 

You can, for example, change the number of columns of videos under the main video by changing the width of the videos.

**For one column, add this:**
.pyw_poster {
width: 100%;
}

**For three columns:**
@media only screen and (min-width: 481px) {
.pyw_poster {
width: 31%;
margin-right: 3%;
}

div.pyw_poster:nth-child(3n+1) {
margin-right: 0;
}
}

**For four, five or six columns, change the values in the code above according to the values below:**
| columns | width | margin-right | :nthchild value |
| 4 | 23% | 2.75% | 4n+1
| 5 | 19% | 1% | 5n+1
| 6 | 15% | 2% | 6n+1

= It does not work, why? =
Double check that you are using a valid YouTube Channel ID. If you go to **https://www.youtube.com/channel/YOUR-CHANNEL-ID**, you should see the channel you want to embed. Then, log on to **https://console.developers.google.com/apis/** double check that you are using a valid API key.

Also check the API key settings, to make sure there are no restrictions API key, preventing it from being used to access YouTube through your site. Refer to Google and YouTube's own documentation of you are unsure about to find out. Make sure there are no unintentional spaces or characters before or after your Channel ID or API key in the settings.

Note that the widget settings are optional, and override the general plugin settings. So even if the plugin settings are correct, you may have a typo in the widget settings. When you are troubleshooting, remember to clear your caches (server- and browser-side) frequently, so you are not seeing old versions of your website.

= Why do my videos stop showing suddenly? =
If your videos show at first, but then stop showing during the day, you may be exceeding the YouTube API's daily quota. That quota is quite generous, so this won't be a problem for most users. However, if you have many thousands of video views daily (or if you are sharing an API key), you may have to apply for a quota extension.

Refer to Google's own documentation for more about [how the daily quota is calculated](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started#quota), or [to apply for an extension](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/yt_api_form).

= I get the error message "The request did not specify any referer. Please ensure that the client is sending referer or use the API Console to remove the referer restrictions.". How do I fix it? =
In the http restrictions section in the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/project/), make sure you have added the domain of the site as it appears under site address in settings. If you can't get it to work at first, add all working versions of your domain, e.g. with both http and https, with and without sub domains, with and without a trailing slash.
